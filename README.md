# WebTest

This project is a basic web portfolio and ESP32 test page, hosted with GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Serves as a personal portfolio page.
- Displays basic data (static for now, later sourced from an ESP32 device).
- Hosts a `firmware.bin` file in the root directory, designed for OTA (Over-the-Air) updates for an ESP32 microcontroller.
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and easily expandable for more features.

## Usage

- Visit the live site: [https://HassRM.github.io/WebTest](https://HassRM.github.io/WebTest)
- To download the ESP32 firmware, click on the "Download firmware.bin" link on the page.

## Future Plans

- Integrate real-time data from an ESP32 device.
- Add backend support for saving and displaying ESP32 data.
- Improve UI and add more personal/project information.
